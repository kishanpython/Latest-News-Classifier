<img src="/static/demo.png" width="500" height="300" />
This project is intended to be a walkthrough on the development of a **machine learning project from end to end**. It covers the creation a real-time web application that gathers data from inshort news app and shows a summary of the different topics that are being treated in the news articles.

This is achieved with a **supervised machine learning classification model** that is able to predict the category of a given news article, a web scraping method that gets the latest news from the inshort news app, and an interactive web application that shows the obtained results to the user.

The web application can be used at https://inshort-news.herokuapp.com/. Please consider that a live web-scraping process is carried out every time you run the app, so there may be some crashes due to the failing status of some requests.
